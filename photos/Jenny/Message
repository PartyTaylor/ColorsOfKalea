In a blink of an eye my teenie weenie wahine is 25❤️ What a beautiful young woman you have become. I’m so proud of you. You’re so giving, compassionate, loving, and you just become more of a beautiful person with each year. I’m so blessed beyond words to be able to call you my daughter. I love you to the moon and back my sweet angle pie.
