My dear sweet Kalea, the love I have for you is foundational to its core. It’s a place you are always welcome to rest in safely, to take a break from the grind, and to take refuge in times of survival. To know that it’s solid, unwavering, unconditional, and soul-long. You have brought so much love and connection to my life. It is so much deeper than friendship, it is sisterhood, you are my family, and I love sharing my life and family with you. I love celebrating you! I am so blessed that I get to witness the unfolding of such a beautiful person inside and out. It’s been an honor to share space and simply be alongside you, cheering you on at any and every point in knowing you. Hooray for frontal lobes! I will forever love you more than ever❤️
