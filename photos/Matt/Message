You came into my life and redefined the meaning of love, pride, and purpose. I’ve watched you grow from a curious little girl into a strong, compassionate, and remarkable woman who inspires me every single day. You’ve faced challenges with courage, embraced opportunities with grace, and carried your heart with kindness in a world that often forgets its value. Know that my love for you is constant, my belief in you is unshakable, and my greatest joy will always be watching you live a life that is authentically yours. You are, and will always be, my greatest baby girl.
