To Kalea, on Her 25th

Kalea is my cousin’s kid,
But feels more like my niece.
One time she wrote my eulogy
For when I am deceased.



She clings to me like static does
Like socks fresh from the dryer,
And climbs into my bed at night
“I hate it”…………..I’m a liar.



We’ve been so many places
New York, where we got sauced-
Vegas, where I almost died,
Hawaii….worth the cost



We’ve shared the quiet kind of grief,
The kind thats built our bond

We’ve also danced through highs so bright,

They’ve lit the path we’re on



She’s needy in the sweetest way,
With chaos in her eyes,
She knows which buttons not to push—
But pushes them. Surprise!



She’s 25 now—wild, I know,
Still doesn’t have a clue,
Still acting like I’m her whole world,
(Which, let’s be honest... true.)



So here’s to you, my clingy girl,
Who acts like I’m her shrine.
I might pretend I’m over it—
But I’m so glad you’re mine
