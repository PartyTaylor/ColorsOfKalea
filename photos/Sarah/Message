To my soul sister. 
Happy birthday! I couldn't be any luckier to exist on this earth, in this universe, at the same time as you. You have been such a positive light in my life and have truly been there for it all, the real great and the real ugly. You shine and light up the lives of everyone who has the pleasure of knowing you. The time we spent together at A&M was full of adventures and fun- thank you fish camp and to you for sticking around through the years. We have had so much fun together and I know time will only continue to nourish our friendship. You continue to make the world and everyone around you a better person. The year of Kalea- I cannot wait to celebrate you, and all the goodness that you are. I love you unconditionally. Thank you for being you. The world is a better place because of you. - Sarah
