Beautiful Kalea,

The world is a brighter place because of your shine. My life is better because you are in it. I see in you the genuine curiosity of a tender child and it is heart warming to watch your eagerness and openness as you sit back and engage life as it comes to you. Your kindness to and engagement with animals and people are a hallmark of a heart practicing unconditional loving. 

Perhaps that unconditional loving was most poignantly displayed when you came over and noticed the absence of Olive and how much that affected you, how much you missed her. I am so beyond thrilled that your love for her moved mountains and now the two of you are miraculously together. I have always wished for Olive to find her human, one who would adore and love her for who she is and I am thrilled that person is you!

I have many memories of us preparing food together whilst sharing experiences and appreciating the beingness of our shared moment and then our appreciation skyrocketing even more as we sat together with lit candle and kitties whilst enjoying our culinary creations. 

Seeing you experiencing your bliss with nature in Costa Rica was sublime! Even tears cleanse and bring us to higher places!

So many memory touch stones, so many more on the way!

I'm celebrating you and wishing you a most spectacular and heart filled trip around the sun this next go around and many more to come!

Much love and Aloha for you, beautiful  soul. ‚ù§Ô∏èüå∏üåü
