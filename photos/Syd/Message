Happy birthday my dearest Kalea!

Another wonderful year on this planet that you’ve been able to experience, and another one full of adventures and love and learning ahead of you!! I love all that you are and am so grateful our paths have crossed. I’m sending so much love and expansive joyful energy for this new year of Kalea!

You are the trees and water and earth, sun and moon. I love you,

<3 Syd
